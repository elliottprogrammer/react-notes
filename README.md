### Paragon technical challenge

#### Details

Note since there will be no back end to this app, the routes don't need to be POST routes, I just included them for clarity of what the different actions should be.
a. Create a React App called “Notes App”, which allows a user to:
i. ( GET /notes ) - View all notes
ii. ( GET /notes/:id ) - View 1 note
iii. ( GET /notes/:id/edit ) - Edit 1 note
iv. ( POST /notes - action ) - Create a note (create form can be on /notes with the note list. Add validation as you see necessary for creating a note.)
v. ( PUT /notes/:id - action, redirect to GET /notes ) - Update 1 note, from the edit page
vi. ( DELETE /notes/:id - action, redirect to GET /notes ) - Delete 1 note, from the View All page
vii. Add simple Unit Testing as you deem appropriate, does not have to be 100% code coverage, just be able to explain the amount of testing and why.
viii. Note - keep it simple, please submit clean code with comments as needed.
ix. Also, please log the number of hours it took you to complete (exclude interruptions/breaks)
